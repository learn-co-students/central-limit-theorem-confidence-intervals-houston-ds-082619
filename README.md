#### Lesson Summary:

This lesson covers the central limit theorem and calculating confidence intervals using the T-distribution. The initial portion investigates the central limit theorem through a simulation which should set the foundation for a discussion with students. From there, confidence intervals are demonstrated by example and students are asked to repeat and then extend the same process, calculating a confidence interval using SciPy for a given sample and then extending that knowledge to repeat this process and visualize the results.
